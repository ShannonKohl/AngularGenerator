TODO:
1. add github location to generated by comment
	- maybe user who built it?
2. instead of using fields, use getters and setters
	- maybe allow public fields? Or just use fields when also annotated with lombok @Data
3. Hateaos
4. figure out where to write the file
	- look at angular config?
	- look for another config?
5. typescript packages (needed for other games)
6. verify don't overwrite files everytime, just generate them if changed (should be handled by build)
7. Add log to build stating where the output files can be found.
8. Fix blank line problems
9. Need to be able to ignore fields, especially if annotated with @JsonIgnore and similar
9. Refactor / cleanup

Phase 2:
1. Springframework @RestController (and other Controllers?) annotation support
2. Add a capability to add to a typescript file or not overwrite it?
	*** Notice if have the capability to modify the class at runtime in TypeScript (JavaScript) then can add modifications through the client-side service
3. Calculate a hash for the file, write it in the comment? (Or keep a hidden file of hashes)
	- use hash to determine if file has changed from previous
	- if changed, update, but only update things that exist in current file? (**** What if something was deleted?, maybe keep a older copy to tell that?)
4. Automatically trigger angular build? How would I know when to do that?
5. Allow auto follow of classes, even if they are not annotated? (Not sure if Java's framework would let me do that?
6. Allow using other annotations, especially Lombok's @Data
